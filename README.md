# 🌟 My MATLAB Basics Journey

Hey there! 👋  
I'm Tammana SaiSrinivas, and this repo is a collection of beginner-friendly **MATLAB exercises** that I personally worked on while learning the language.

Whether you're just getting started or revisiting the basics, I hope these mini scripts help you practice core concepts in a fun and simple way.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

These scripts cover a wide range of **fundamental topics** that are essential for mastering MATLAB:

- 🧮 Arithmetic operations and variables  
- 📊 Arrays and matrices  
- 🔁 Loops and conditionals  
- 📈 Plotting (sin, cos, bar graphs, etc.)  
- 🧩 Functions  
- 🔍 Data handling and string basics  

## ✨ Why I Made This

I’m learning MATLAB as part of my journey in aerospace and engineering. These are the very exercises I used to build up my basics — and I wanted to share them in case they help someone else starting out too!

Feel free to use them, tweak them, or even contribute your own variations.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can open any `.m` file in **MATLAB** (or Octave) and run them directly.  
Or use the command line:
```matlab
run('03_fibonacci_series.m')
